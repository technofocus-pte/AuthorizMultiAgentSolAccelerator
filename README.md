# Prior Authorization Review — Multi-Agent Solution Accelerator

A **multi-agent** AI-assisted prior authorization (PA) review application built
with the **Microsoft Agent Framework**, **Claude Agent SDK**, and **Anthropic
& DeepSense Healthcare MCP Servers**. Three specialized agents — Compliance, Clinical
Reviewer, and Coverage — work in parallel and sequence, coordinated by an
orchestrator that applies a gate-based decision rubric and produces a final
recommendation with confidence scoring and an audit justification document.

Incorporates best practices from the
[Anthropic prior-auth-review-skill](https://github.com/anthropics/healthcare/tree/main/prior-auth-review-skill):
LENIENT mode decision policy, per-criterion MET/NOT_MET/INSUFFICIENT evaluation,
confidence scoring, progressive gate evaluation, and structured audit trails.

## <img src="./docs/images/readme/business-scenario.svg" width="48" /> Business Scenario

|![Prior Authorization Review — Application Interface](./docs/images/readme/interface.png)|
|---|

<br/>

Healthcare organizations processing prior authorization (PA) requests face significant challenges in coordinating complex clinical reviews across multiple departments. They must evaluate medical necessity, verify coverage policies, and produce auditable decisions — often under strict regulatory timelines. Some of the challenges they face include:

- **High volume** — U.S. providers submit ~[300 million PA requests per year](https://www.caqh.org/insights/caqh-index-report) (CAQH Index)
- **Manual, time-consuming reviews** — each request takes [15–20 minutes](https://web.archive.org/web/20240829144735/https://www.ama-assn.org/system/files/prior-authorization-survey.pdf) of clinician and staff time (AMA, 2024)
- **Slow turnaround** — average PA decision takes [5–14 business days](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/cms-interoperability-and-prior-authorization-final-rule-cms-0057-f)
- **Inconsistent assessments** — manual reviews are subject to reviewer variability
- **Regulatory pressure** — CMS mandates [electronic PA by 2026–2027](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/cms-interoperability-and-prior-authorization-final-rule-cms-0057-f) with 72-hour urgent and 7-day standard response limits (CMS-0057-F)

By using the *Prior Authorization Review — Multi-Agent Solution Accelerator*, organizations can automate these processes, ensuring that all clinical reviews are accurately coordinated, auditable, and executed efficiently.

### Use Case
<details>
  <summary>Click to learn more about the prior authorization use case</summary>

  | Scenario | Persona | Challenges | Solution Approach |
  |----------|---------|------------|-------------------|
  | PA intake triage | Utilization Review Nurse | Manually checking demographics, provider credentials, codes, and clinical notes quality for completeness is time-consuming and error-prone. | **Compliance Agent** validates all required documentation in seconds, flagging missing or insufficient fields before clinical review begins. |
  | Clinical evidence review | Medical Director | Extracting structured clinical data, validating ICD-10 codes, and searching PubMed for supporting evidence takes 15–30 minutes per case. | **Clinical Reviewer Agent** automates clinical data extraction, code validation, and literature/trial search using MCP-connected healthcare data sources. |
  | Coverage policy evaluation | PA Coordinator | Looking up Medicare NCDs/LCDs, mapping each policy criterion to clinical evidence, and documenting medical necessity assessments is manual and inconsistent. | **Coverage Agent** searches CMS coverage databases, verifies provider credentials, and produces auditable MET/NOT_MET/INSUFFICIENT criterion mappings. |
  | Final decision synthesis | Clinical Reviewer | Combining findings from multiple reviewers into a consistent, auditable recommendation with confidence scoring requires significant coordination. | **Orchestrator + Synthesis** evaluates a gate-based rubric (Provider → Codes → Medical Necessity), produces a recommendation with confidence scores, and generates notification letters and audit PDFs. |

### Security guidelines

This solution accelerator handles **Protected Health Information (PHI)** and clinical data. Security best practices are critical for any deployment.

All API keys and connection strings are stored in a local `.env` file that is excluded from source control via `.gitignore`. For Azure deployments, we recommend using [Azure Key Vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/general/overview) to manage secrets and [Managed Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) to authenticate between Azure resources without storing credentials in code.

To ensure continued best practices in your own repository, we recommend that anyone creating solutions based on our templates ensure that the [GitHub secret scanning](https://docs.github.com/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning) setting is enabled.

You may want to consider additional security measures, such as:

* Enabling [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/defender-for-cloud/) to secure your Azure resources.
* Protecting the Azure Container Apps instance with a [firewall](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/waf-app-gateway) and/or [Virtual Network](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/networking?tabs=workload-profiles-env%2Cazure-cli).
* Enabling [encryption at rest](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/security/fundamentals/encryption-atrest) for all data stores containing PHI.
* Implementing role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict who can submit, review, and override prior authorization decisions.
* Ensuring HIPAA compliance by signing a [Business Associate Agreement (BAA)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/compliance/offerings/offering-hipaa-us) with Microsoft for production workloads.
