"""Synthesis Decision Hosted Agent — MAF entry point.

Synthesizes outputs from Compliance, Clinical, and Coverage agents into
a final APPROVE or PEND recommendation using gate-based evaluation,
weighted confidence scoring, and a structured audit trail.

Deployed as a Foundry Hosted Agent via azure.ai.agentserver.
No MCP connections required — synthesis is pure reasoning over agent outputs.
Structured output enforced via default_options={"response_format": SynthesisOutput},
which from_agent_framework passes through to every agent.run() call.
